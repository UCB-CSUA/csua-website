<h3>The Politburo</h3>

while school is in regular session. The Politburo shall
determine temporary policies of the CSUA. Politburo decisions
may be overturned by a two-thirds vote of the general
membership at a general meeting. </p>

<h3>Other Committees</h3>

<p>Other committees may be created or dissolved at the direction
of either the Politburo, or by a majority vote of the general
membership at a General Meeting.  Directorships or other non-politburo 
positions shall be appointed by the president and confirmed by the 
majority of the politburo.</p>

<h2>Article VI. Election of Officers</h2>

<h3>A. Time and Place of Elections</h3>

<p>Officers shall be selected each semester by a majority vote of
the attending General Membership at a General Meeting held no
less than two weeks before the last day of instruction,
announced no less than one week in advance, and held at a time
and place that is considered generally accessible as well in
compliance with ASUC regulations concerning accessibility of
ASUC sponsored activities. </p>

<h3>B. Procedure</h3>

<p>The chair shall appoint an election officer, who shall not
vote or run for office. The election officer must be a member.
Members shall be nominated until no more are willing and
eligible. No person shall be nominated who is not willing to
serve upon their election, and no person not present can be
nominated for an office without his or her written consent
being presented at the meeting. If only one candidate is in
nomination voting may be done by acclamation. Otherwise voting
shall be done by secret ballot of active members. A ballot that
is blank or otherwise does not uniquely identify a nominated
candidate shall not be counted.</p>

<p>If there is at any time a majority for a candidate, that
candidate wins. If there is no majority and there are two
candidates the election officer shall cast the deciding vote.
If there is no majority and there are three candidates, the one
with the fewest votes shall be eliminated. If there is a tie
among those with the fewest votes the election officer shall
select one to be eliminated.</p>

<p>If there are more than three candidates, three shall be
selected to proceed to a runoff round as follows. Select as
many candidates as possible for the runoff, starting from those
with the highest vote totals, until it is impossible to proceed
without selecting more than three or discriminating between
candidates who received the same number of votes. If it is not
possible to select any candidates in this way because there is
a tie for first, the election officer shall cast a vote for one
of the tied first-place candidates. If there are then fewer
than three candidates selected for the runoff round, a new vote
shall be held among those candidates not already chosen to
select the remaining candidates.</p>

<h2>Article VII. Removal and Replacement of Officers</h2>

<h3>A. Removal</h3>

<p>An officer may be removed from office in one of the following ways: </p>

<ul>
<li>In the event of extended unexplained absence of an
officer, the office may be declared vacant by a majority of
the remaining officers.</li>
<li>Any officer no longer qualified to hold office shall be
removed.</li>
<li>A unanimous vote of the other officers in office may
remove an officer from office.</li>
<li>In the event of a vacancy of an office the President will be 
responsible for ensuring that the obligations of that office are 
fulfilled until a replacement has been made.</li>
</ul>

<h3>B. Replacement</h3>

<p>In case of removal or resignation from office of one of the
elected officers except the President, the President shall
appoint a successor. All such appointments to office must be
confirmed by a majority vote of the Politburo at the next
announced Politburo meeting. As stated in Article IV, in the
event the office of President is vacated for whatever reason,
the Vice-President shall either assume the office of president
without need for confirmation and appoint a successor to be
approved by a majority vote of a quorum of the Politburo, or,
with the approval of a majority vote of the Politburo at the
next announced Politburo meeting, appoint an eligible member to
assume the office of president.</p>

<p>If both the offices of President and Vice-President are
vacated in such a way to obstruct the aforementioned order of
succession, then the remaining officers, in the order of
Treasurer, Secretary, Librarian, Events Officer, and Alumni 
relations officer may either assume the office of President 
or, with the approval of the general membership, appoint a new 
President who will then fill any remaining open offices.</p>

shall call and chair a general meeting to elect new officers.</p>

<h2>Article VIII. Meetings</h2>

may be approved by a two-thirds majority of general meeting
convened during instruction with at least two weeks notice of

remaining assets shall be donated to a campus computing
organization which allows free access to all University of
California at Berkeley students. </p>

<p><em>All unspent ASUC funds shall remain the property of
